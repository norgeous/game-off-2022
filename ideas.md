# to do / discussion

## game

- start scene / main menu
- game over scene
better narrative
  - more tiles sets (perhaps forest > city > inside building)
  - introduce 1 zombie first, later hoards of zombies
- post-processing + lighting (might be worth spending a day on?)
- show keyboard bindings somewhere on screen (IMPORTANT)
- settings menu?
  - volume control or mute button?
- score system, high scores?
- points system? 
  - points for killing zombies?
  - leaderboard
- request fullscreen on first click?


## ui

- menus uis (start game, pause, options.)
- maybe classic old style test all sounds menu? 
- inventory?


## player

- inventory overlay?
- cliche phrases tts / sounds

## weapons

- bullet spread
- machine gun fire rate needs adjusting
- particle effects
  - ricochet effects when bouncing off terrain (+ sound?)
  - muzzle flash on bullet spawn location
- weapon animations
  - impact 
  - explode
- pickup items from level? or class based?
- more items than gun and bomb? meele attack?


## enemies

- hide inactive health bars after a few seconds
- blood particle effect?
- sounds
- more enemies and boss enemy (maybe just tint / hue shift existing enemy)
- improve spawing / spawners 
  - spawn animation?
    - climb out of hole in wall or ground?
    - reverse frames of death anim
- add civilians / animals


## sound and music

- player hurt
- zombie noise? 
- zombie take damage? 
- player jump?
- item pickup


## bits and bobs

- Extra life? 
- take damage flash is too much (should we put an epilepsy warning due to this or let the player turn it off?)
- maybe show points on screen when you kill a zombie? 
- zombies attack each other? 
- parallax background images don't repeat. can look weird sometimes. 
- maps need finishing up 
  - all spawn points in place
  - all item pickups in place
  - levels tested from start to finish
